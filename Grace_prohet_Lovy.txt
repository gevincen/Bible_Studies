before grace : definition of favour

Grace : unlimited favour in everything
you just come, allow him to do the work
depths and dimension
people having favour with people (in scripture)
project : favour with people
if grace : people come from all around to support
Esther, Daniel, David -- all this men had favour

Even Jesus din't have it, pemitted to have it
Gen 9:1-4 
favour doesn't make you prosper
prosper : tied with God
Joseph was a slave but prosperous man
ceder of lebenon, ever green go green
prosperity begins in the place of submission
Joseph : didn't domintae his master

too much : unforgiveness, judgemental, bitterness, 

solomon :
give me wisdom to lead your people
Lord Jesus add everything else on me

Deeper Grace:
=============
another force supported Joseph's success


extra contraversial (pay attention, this one is going to shock you):
===================================================================
when people resist you who sent it to you
under Joseph's control
pottiphor gave everything

How grace is very dangerous:
============================
tested for it by God
God asked David an interesting question?
2 Sam 12:7-8

pride is the killer

what unlocks: (2 things)
=======================
pure heart
maintains the presence of God
God will give you grace 

Joseph never saw Jesus face to face but God gave him grace

meek and consistant 

what is in your heart 

acceptable yaer of the Lord : no eneimies
