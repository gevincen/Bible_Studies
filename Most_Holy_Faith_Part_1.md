# Most Holy Faith : Part 1
## Jude 1:20-21 KJV
[20] But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, \
[21] Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

* There is a gap or gulf between man and God.
* It was not so when God created man and placed him in the Garden of Eden.
* God and man had a close fellowship with one another.
* Due to disobedience of man there was a gap between man and God.
* Then God initiated various ways to restore the fellowship with man 
  * told them to build Tabernacle to dwell among them 
  * gave commandments, laws, offerings, sacrifices, rituals, etc
  * they sincerely did all, obeyed but yet hearts were away from the Lord

# Tabernacle, Offering, sacrifices, yet their hearts were far away from the Lord
## Jeremiah 7:21-23 KJV
[21] Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. \
[22] For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: \
[23] But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.\

* they did everything whatever the law required but their hearts were never closer to God
* Even after building the temple, Solomon built the temple, glory filled the temple but their hearts were not dedicated to the Lord
* so God removed Tabernacle and also removed the Temple of Solomon I & II 
* In the NT God brings another method to bridge the gap between man and God
* He brought Jesus Christ 
* JC is/became the one between God and man  

Hebrews 10:19-20 KJV
[19] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, \
[20] By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; \

* man who could not come to the holy place or most holy place, through calvery could enter into the most holy place by faith. 
* In short, by faith man can enter into this place.
* In this faith, there is a standard of faith, when you go/grow on step by step, you can come to the highest/pinacle std of faith which is most holy faith.
* If this faith is destroyed you can not stand in the spiritual life

Luke 22:32 KJV
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

* Satan asked permission to swift Peter like wheat, Christ could have refused that permission; He didn't say that but permitted. But prayed that faith should not fail
* Question comes why ? when doing good I am misunderstood, when doing good you have sickenss, failure, pain, situations others don't have, why? why trials to me? Jesus could have not allowed it, but why God allowed it? 
* You see God is silently waiting, not only waiting but praying for you, in that trial if you stand and retain that faith, able to keep the faith in the modst of the trial, then you will be victorious
* The pbm is how to preserve the faith in the midst of the trial, here Jesus prayed for Peter
* Elder wrote to C John, Pastor all forgot to pray for me, Pastor replied, may be true, all forgot to pray for but One person never forgets you. i.e., Jesus, never sleeps nor slumber to pray for you.
* We are here beause one interceeds on our behalf, never think you are forgotten

# Faith is like a TREE
Luke 17:6 KJV
And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

When you sow a seed, dies, grows and becomes a tree.

You can meditate Faith as a Tree, or as a  Mountain.
